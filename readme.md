Template to start a new latex project.

Relies on [this submodule](https://github.com/cirosantilli/latex-submodule) to factor code out.

You can get this template with:

    PROJECT_NAME=name

    git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/latex-template $PROJECT_NAME
    cd $PROJECT_NAME
    rm -rf .git/
    git init
    rmdir shared
    git submodule add https://github.com/cirosantilli/latex-submodule shared
    git add `ls -A`
    git commit -am 'init'

# Rationale

## Getting the clone

Instead of cloning and removing the history with:

    git clone https://github.com/cirosantilli/latex-template $PROJECT_NAME
    cd $PROJECT_NAME
    git rm -rf .git/

downloading a zip generated by github via:

    wget https://github.com/cirosantilli/latex-template/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    mv latex-template-master $PROJECT_NAME

would be better in the sense that less data would be downloaded (no history).

We have decided to stick to git for the following reasons:

- downloading the zip introduces 2 non POSIX dependencies: `wget` and `unzip`

- depends on the github interface, so if we ever decide to move to another server,
    there would be work to be done
